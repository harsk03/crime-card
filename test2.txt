Sample 4: Man Arrested in Delhi Metro Acid Attack Incident
New Delhi, April 5 – Chaos erupted at the Rajiv Chowk metro station yesterday afternoon when a 23-year-old woman became the victim of a horrifying acid attack. The suspect, identified as Aman Verma (27), was apprehended on the spot by alert CISF personnel. Eyewitnesses report that the man was seen loitering on the platform minutes before the assault occurred.

The victim suffered severe burns to her face and neck and is currently undergoing treatment at AIIMS trauma center. Doctors have confirmed third-degree burns, and her condition is critical but stable. According to police sources, the accused and the victim were previously in a relationship that ended recently. The attack appears to be an act of vengeance following repeated threats and harassment.

Delhi Police Commissioner Sanjay Meena condemned the attack and praised the metro security staff for their swift response. “We have initiated legal proceedings under IPC sections 326A and 307. This incident reaffirms the need for stricter surveillance and instant grievance reporting mechanisms in public transport zones,” he said. A fast-track court trial has also been proposed.
